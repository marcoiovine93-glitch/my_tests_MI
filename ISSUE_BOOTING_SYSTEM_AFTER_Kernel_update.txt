CAUSES:
- Before the issue came out at the rebooting of the system, we observed that there was an error when trying to upgrade the
  system --> in particular OpenAFS seemed to be not ugraded at a version compatible with the new Kernel 6.17.0
- This was the huge mistake: this problem was just the top of the real issue, because the upgrade problems were probably caused by the problem
  with the new Kernel version;


ISSUE:
- whnen trying to reboot, we saw the purple screen with : 
KERNEL PANIC!
Please reboot your computer.
VPS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)

- The only way to do something, was to turn off the system with the button and turn on again
- We then saw a menu: the only selectable options were: Ubuntu, UEFI (the firmware)
- By clicking on the Ubuntu option, we got the same purple screen described before;
- so clicked "e" on the Ubuntu option --> then Ctrl+C
- A new screen with the user as "grub>" will open up
- In this screen it is possible to chedck the system partitions available
- so a thing that we can do is to run the ls command to check them
- The proper to see it is: WE ENTERED THE GRUP SHELL!!
- WE need to find which partition contains the Ubuntu Files for the booting of the system
    - so we run ls <name_of_partition> (for example: (hd0,gpt2))
    - we run it until we find the one that contains the files
- ONCE WE FIND IT, we set the root as the found partition:
    - root <name_of_partition>
- we run: linux /vmlinuz-6.14.0-37-generic root=/dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-ubuntu--lv
- we run: initrd /initrd.img-6.14.0-37-generic
- boot
- THE SYSTEM IS ABLE TO BOOT. WHY?
    - because the issue consists in the absence of a link to make Ubuntu to run on the specific File System corresponding to 
      the computer and, more important, to the Permanent storage system (An NVMe SSD) --> this bridge is the file initrd !!!
    - initrd provides the drivers needed to make Ubuntu capable to a Storage system of that kind
    - it is important to note that our PC make use also of LVM to manage the files !!! (Logical volumes and probable Volume groups!!)
- BUT AFTER REBOOTING THE SYSTEM, WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THE CHANGES ARE PERMANENT:
    - we modify the file: /etc/initramfs-tools/modules
        - we add the lines:
        nvme
        dm-mod
        dm-mirror
        dm-snapshot
    - we run commands to reinstall/update both initramfs and grub :
        - sudo grub-install /dev/nvme0n1
        - sudo update-initramfs -u -k all
        - sudo update-initramfs -u -k 6.14.0-37-generic
        - sudo update-initramfs -c -k 6.17.0-14-generic (we need to update for both versions of the kernel)
        - sudo update-grub
